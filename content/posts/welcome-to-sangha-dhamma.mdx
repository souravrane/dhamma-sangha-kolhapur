# Welcome to Sangha Dhamma

Welcome to our community where we explore Buddha's teachings through a scientific, evidence-aware lens.

## Our Approach

We believe that the wisdom of the Buddha can be understood and practiced in harmony with modern scientific understanding. Our community emphasizes:

- **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Evidence-based practices for mental well-being
- **Scientific Inquiry**: Exploring the intersection of Buddhist philosophy and contemporary research
- **Community Support**: Building connections through shared practice and understanding

## What to Expect

Join us for:

- Weekly meditation sessions
- Discussion groups on Buddhist texts
- Workshops on mindfulness and compassion
- Community events and retreats

We look forward to walking this path together with you.

_May all beings be happy and free from suffering._
